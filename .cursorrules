# Principles

- Follow the project's existing conventions and patterns.
- Prefer strong typing throughout the codebase.
- Avoid using `any` or `unknown` types unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not use type assertions; instead, define or refine types as needed.
- Create and use explicit types or interfaces for complex structures.
- Prefer using node-sql-parser's API and types for SQL parsing and analysis.

# Code Style

- Prefer concise code changes and minimal extra explanatory text.
- Keep code changes minimal and focused on the requested functionality.

# Development Workflow

- Always use `pnpm test` or its variations to run tests.
- Always use `pnpm lint` to run linting.
- Always use `pnpm typecheck` to run typechecking.
- Ensure all code changes pass tests, linting, and typechecking before merging.
